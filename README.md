## Hello!

I work in the [Meuleman lab](http://www.meuleman.org/) at the [Altius Institute](http://www.altius.org/) to help simplify and enhance analysis of, presentation of, and interaction with complex and large-scale datasets. The following repositories are tools and code snippets I've made or contributed to, along the way. Share and enjoy!
